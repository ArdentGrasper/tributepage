      <h1><strong>Here's brief history:</strong></h1>
     
<br>
<h2> <li><strong>Sex life :P -</strong></li></h2><font size="5">Adam Levine knows he has a reputation for being a man whore. However, he has an explanation: He was raised by mostly women (and a gay brother) and just loves the female form so much.><br>
There's no denying that Maroon 5 lead singer Adam Levine is super duper hot, but we always figured he was a player obsessed with sex. Turns out we're right, but The Voice judge said it's only because he's "terrified of being alone" and loves women so much.
<br><br>
"I've always felt a little misrepresented in the world," he explained to the magazine. "I felt like people only knew me as a singer who dated pretty girls. A little bit of a bimbo. Maybe I was kind of a bimbo... I was the dude that was naked all the time with girls, and that's fine, no problem with that. But I wanted to create a little balance. When [The Voice] came around, I thought, 'People now know that I have a brain.'"<br><br>

The Los Angeles native has romanced a whole bevy of beautiful Hollywood starlets, including Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton and — most recently — Russian Victoria's Secret model Anne V. He's also dated mere mortals, like cocktail server Rebecca Ginos.</font>
      <h2><p2>List of his 10 best songs:</h2></p2><br>
     
<font size="5">10. “Payphone” Feat. Wiz Khalifa<br><br>

Even though a payphone seems like a communication tool relic which may only be unearthed in an archaeological dig, this track from Maroon 5’s fourth studio album Overexposed is impossible to forget. Adam Levine nails desperation at the appropriately perfect times and we can’t help but root for him to reach the girl he’s emphatically pining to talk to.<br><br>

9. “Goodnight, Goodnight”<br><br>

Adam Levine tells very visual stories in his lyrics. He penned this song for Maroon 5’s second studio album, It Won’t Be Soon Before Long. It topped charts in Hong Kong and was featured in an episode of “CSI: NY.” As in many of his songs, Levine ruminates about things he could have done better in his relationship with his girl. The split screen “Before” and “After” video concept is really neat and tells the couple’s love story in an intriguing, emotional way.<br><br>

8. “Sunday Morning”
<br><br>
This track from Songs About Jane has some jazz-influenced moments and Adam Levine’s silky smooth vocal makes us feel as breezy as the Sunday morning vibe he describes. The single made the U.S. Top 40, peaking at No. 31 and was featured in the romantic movies “Something’s Gotta Give” and “Love Actually.”<br><br>

7. “Harder to Breathe”<br><br>

This song is considered Maroon 5’s breakout lead single from their debut album Songs About Jane. It’s a nice stylistic blend of Rock and R & B. While it plays like a story about a couple in distress, the lyrics were actually born from Adam Levine’s frustration about the pressure the label was putting on them to come up with more singles. The finished product caught everyone’s attention and Songs About Jane became one of the hottest records of 2002.<br><br>

6. “Makes Me Wonder”
<br><br>
This catchy track was the first single from It Won’t Be Soon Before Long and mark’s the band’s first No. 1 song. The song follows suit with many of Levine’s songs about failed relationships, but carries dual meaning in his confusion over the political climate of the time. The song impressively snagged the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.
<br><br>
5. “Misery”
<br><br>
The melody for this tune is infectious and makes the song so fun to sing. Adam Levine employs his signature falsetto in all the right places and the chorus just pops. It’s the lead single from their third studio album Hands All Over. It shot to the top of Billboard’s U.S. Adult Top 40 chart and received a Grammy nod for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.<br><br>

4. “She Will Be Loved”<br><br>

It’s probably impossible for Maroon 5’s large legion of female fans not to swoon over this anthem-like ballad about a woman getting the love and respect she deserves. The Grammy-nominated single hit No. 1 on both the Mainstream Top 40 and Adult Top 40 charts. Can anyone musically plead better than Adam Levine? This song is perfect proof of his vocally love-struck prowess.
<br><br>
3. “Daylight”<br><br>

Who wouldn’t want to hold Adam Levine, “oh-whoa-oh” so close as this lovely ballad describes? The song is the third single from Overexposed and arguably one of the band’s most romantic, slow-danceable and singable tracks. Like several previous hits, the soft ballad hit No. 1 on the Mainstream and Adult Top 40 charts.<br><br>

2. “Moves Like Jagger” Feat. Christina Aguilera<br><br>

There are just too many fun, fabulous things about this song to list. First of all, big points for the shout out to Mr. Mick’s signature Rolling Stones swagger. And, okay, how cool is it that “The Voice” coaches are singing together on this track? Oh, and we love the opening whistle, don't we? This fourth single from Hands All Over earned a well-deserved Grammy nod for Best Pop Duo/Group Vocal Performance. It was a huge commercial success, as the ninth best-selling digital single in 2011 and it topped all kinds of international charts, including the U.S. Mainstream Top 40, Adult Top 40 and Billboard Hot 100.
<br><br>
1. “This Love”<br><br>

Adam Levine has penned a lot of breakup songs, but this may be one of his most emotional and erotic writing endeavors. “This Love” hails from Maroon 5’s remarkable debut album Songs About Jane. It topped several international charts and won the Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. It received constant, heavy airplay and remains one of the band's most successful singles. It ultimately lands in this ranking’s top spot for Maroon 5’s best song.
